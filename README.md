Functions for OSL Bioturbation and Time Percentage Analysis per McKee &amp; Frederick (n.d.)

This package is being actively developed in preparation for a paper discussing rates of bioturbation at archeological sites in the East Texas Sandy Mantle. The functions in this package are largely written using Tidyverse libraries in order to analyze and plot single-grain optically stimulated luminescence dates. The analytical functions generally allow the user to translate raw single-grain OSL dosimetric results to calendar ages and apply a discrete integrals to report on the representative fracton of time in a given sample. Full data for presented in the publication will be released in this package once the paper is through peer review.

The functions are currently considered minimally functional for other users. Substantial updates with additional functions are expected in the near future.
