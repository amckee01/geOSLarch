Description: McKee & Frederick (n.d.) proposed a set of analytical tools for studying single-grain optically-stimulated luminescence dates in bioturbated sediments. The functions in this package perform the workflow outlined in that paper. In general, these tools provide a processing workflow for estimating the degree of bioturbation through a soil profile, and provide estimates of how much of the sediment at a given depth is younger than a proposed age.
